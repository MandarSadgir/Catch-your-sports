                       <h3>Preview:</h3> <br>
<p>Despite Covid concerns in the country, the tour will go ahead with small changes in the schedule. South Africa will take on India in the 1st of the 3 matches Test series which will kick start from Sunday. South Africa hasn’t lost a Test series at home against India and it’s going to be a challenging task for them to maintain the record. They had won their previous series against West Indies 2-0 in West Indies. They are still under transition and are hopeful of achieving big under the leadership of Dean Elgar.</p> <br>

<p>India, on the other hand, has done exceedingly well in Australia and England in the last 12 months, and now it’s time for them to conquer the Proteas where they have yet to win a Test series. With a lot of controversies happening behind the doors, it will be an important tour for skipper Virat Kohli and coach Rahul Dravid. They are currently placed 4th in the WTC standings with 42 points to their name.</p><br>

<h3>Top Picks for SA vs IND Dream11 Match:</h3><br>
<h4>Top Picks ­– Batters</h4><br>
<h4>Dean Elgar</h4> is a specialist batter in this format of the game and patience is his key mantra. He has scored 4347 runs in 69 Test matches at an average of close to 40 and even picked up 15 wickets as well.

<h4>Virat Kohli</h4> has a lot to prove as a batter and even more a skipper in this tour. He is hungry for runs and it will be interesting how he approaches this match. He has mustered 7801 runs in 97 Test matches at an average of 50.65.
<br><br>
<h3>Top Picks ­– All-Rounders</h3><br>
<h4>Wiaan Mulder</h4> has shown a lot of promise in the early stages of his career. In his 6 Test matches, he has scalped 14 wickets and scored 143 runs with the bat.

<h4>Ravichandran Ashwin</h4> is a good competitor when it comes to Test cricket and holds many records as well. He will be the frontline spinner as Jadeja is ruled out with an injury.
<br><br>
<h3>Top Picks ­– Bowlers</h3>
<h4>Kagiso Rabada</h4> is a fierce fast bowler and knows the South African surfaces really well. He can swing the ball both ways and can cause problems with his deadly bouncers too. He has scalped 213 wickets in 47 Test matches and even scored 693 runs with the bat.
<br><br>
<h4>Jasprit Bumrah</h4> has a fond memory on South Africa soil as he made his Test debut here in 2018. In his just 24 Test matches, he has bagged 101 wickets with the best figures of 6 for 27 in an innings.
<br><br>
<h3>Top Picks ­– Wicketkeepers</h3>
<h4>Quinton de Kock</h4> plays his natural game irrespective of the situation. He has accumulated 3245 runs in his 53 Test matches at an average of 39.09.
